# Use
The executable can either be called from the command line, have a file or directory dragged onto it, or run in a folder containing .bytes of .json files from Sunless Skies. Command line arguments are enumerated below.
If dragging files onto the executable, either an individual file or a directory can be passed. When a single file is passed, the program will encrypt or decrypt it based on its file extension. Otherwise, it will encrypt or decrypt files in the passed directory according to the file extension of whichever file it sees first.
If run inside a directory containing .bytes or.json files, it will encrypt or decrypt files in the directory according to the file extension of whichever file it sees first. Resulting files will be created inside a new directory next to the executable.

# Arguments
`--decrypt=<path_to_file>`
Accepts as input either a single .bytes file or a directory containing .bytes files. If a single file is passed, converts it to the corresponding .json file and creates said file next to the executable. If a directory is passed, the resulting .json files will be created in a new directory next to the executable.

`--encrypt=<path_to_file>`
Accepts as input either a single .json file or a directory containing .json files. If a single file is passed, converts it to the corresponding .bytes file and creates said file next to the executable. If a directory is passed, the resulting .bytes files will be created in a new directory next to the executable.
